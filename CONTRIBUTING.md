## Scoring System

As part of GSSoC, contributors will earn points based on the complexity and impact of their contributions. Here's how points are awarded:

- *Level 1 (10 points)*: Minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, or small enhancements.
- *Level 2 (25 points)*: Medium-level features or bug fixes that require more in-depth work, such as improving a module, adding new functionality, or enhancing testing.
- *Level 3 (45 points)*: Major contributions like implementing significant features, refactoring large parts of the codebase, or fixing critical bugs.

All contributions will be reviewed, and the maintainers will assign points based on the effort and impact.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the project's code style (describe the language or framework conventions).
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Ensure tests cover your changes.
- Run linting and formatting tools as required.

## Getting Started


### 1. Clone the Repository


*Understanding Cloning:*

Cloning creates a local copy of the project on your computer, allowing you to work on it independently. This local copy is a mirror image of the original repository on GitHub or similar platforms.


Use Git to clone this repository into your local development environment:

bash
git clone https://github.com/dhairyagothi/StationGuide.git


*After Cloning*
You will see this interface in your system :

### 3. Running the Development Server

## Frontend:

- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
```Bash
cd frontend
```

- Start the frontend development server :
```Bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically launch the React application on http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your browser.

## Backend:

- Open another terminal or command prompt window (separate from the frontend window).
- Navigate to the backend directory:
```Bash
cd backend
```

Start the backend development server (typically using nodemon server.js or a similar command):
```Bash
npm run start
```
